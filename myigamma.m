        % matrix, guaranteeing that all the eigenvalues (roots) will be real.

    % This function determines the abscisas (x) and weights (w)  for the        %
    % Gauss-Legendre quadrature, of order n>1, on the interval [-1, +1].        %
    %   Unlike many publicly available functions, 'GaussLegendre_2' is valid    %
    %   for n>=46. This is due to the fact that 'GaussLegendre_2' does not      %
    %   rely on the build-in Matlab routine 'roots' to determine the roots of   %
    %   the Legendre polynomial, but finds the roots by looking for the         %
    %   eigenvalues of an alternative version of the companion matrix of the    %
    %   n'th degree Legendre polynomial. The companion matrix is constructed    %
    %   as a symmetrical matrix, guaranteeing that all the eigenvalues          %
    %   (roots) will be real. On the contrary, the 'roots' function uses a      %
    %   general form for the companion matrix, which becomes unstable at        %
    %   higher orders n, leading to complex roots.                              %
